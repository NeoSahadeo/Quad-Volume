## Why does this exist?

The normal volume slider for Apple Music is a linear step and the soft volumes,
between 0.001 and 0.3, are really hard to control on Apple Music's current
slider. Their slider increments in 0.1 and the slider is too short to have
any fine-grained control.

This is what my extension aims to solve by applying a quadratic curve to the
audio slider so the soft volumes will have a larger area on the volume slider
which gives more fine-grained control to the player.
